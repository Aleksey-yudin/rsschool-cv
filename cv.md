About Me:
In short... I was born in Moscow, it was 1991. 
I strive to make people's lives more convenient and interesting.
Prefer minimalism. Great.

What did I do before? 
I have a long experience working with IT-companies where i was solving problems of its users and clients.
Originally, I was thinking about being a web developer, but when it came to practice... I began to wonder what the site elements should look like, how to arrange them, etc.
While I was searching for answers to these questions, the Internet has presented me with a vast world of UX/UI design.

And so finally, having tasted UX/UI, I came back to become a great Frontend developer.
